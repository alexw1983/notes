                <p>
                    Git is a piece of software that tracks changes to files. It is mostly used by software developers to
                    manage changes and to coordinate between each other. Git uses the concept of repositories
                    (often referred to as repos). These are basically just folders in which git will track any changes
                    to
                    files and folders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Git saves changes to files in what are called commits. A commit can be thought of like a save point.
                    Every batch of changes is stored in a commit and will have a unique id. One of the great features of
                    git
                    is that you can rollback to an earlier commit if you make a mistake. This is often used to correct
                    broken releases.
                </p>

                    Github is a website that stores git repositories. It has a lot of extra features but basically it is
                    a
                    central place to store your repositories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is really useful for developers collaborating on projects. Usually there will be a central
                    repository in github and developers <strong>clone</strong> the repository to their local machines.
                    Any
                    changes can be made safely and merged in after review.
                </p>
                <p>The basic flow goes like this (more details below):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Clone</strong> the repo locally or <strong>pull</strong> the latest changes if you
                        already
                        have it locally.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a <strong>branch</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Publish</strong> that branch to github.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stage</strong> any changes then <strong>commit</strong> them. Repeat as many times as
                        you like.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Push</strong> those changes to github. Note you will need to be a collaborator on the
                        repo to allow you to do this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a <strong>Pull Request</strong> and get a peer review.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Merge</strong> in to master.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>How to Clone a Repository</h2>
                <p>Cloning a repository creates a local copy of the repository on your machine and allows you to track
                    the changes between the two.</p>
                <code>
                    git clone "path_to_repository"
                </code>
                <p>Replace "path_to_repository" you can get this from git hub by going to the repo and clicking the down
                    arrow next to the green "Code" button and copying the url under the https tab.</p>
                <img src="../images/path-to-repo.png" alt="github" width="600">

                    How to Create a Branch
                </h2>
                <p>A branch is a way of making changes withour affecting our master branch. A branch can be thought of
                    as a copy of the code. You can switch between branches as much as you like. All repositories come
                    with one branch as standard either called <strong>master</strong> or <strong>main</strong>. You
                    should create a branch before making any changes.</p>
                <code>
                        git checkout -b "name-of-your-branch"
                    </code>
                <p>Replace "name-of-your-branch" with a sensible name for your branch. You should avoid using spaces in
                    your branch names.</p>
                <p>
                    You can see which branch you are on by using
                </p>
                <code>
                        git branch
                    </code><br />
                <img src="../images/brnach-demo.png" alt="branch demo" width="400">
                <p>VSCode also has tools to help you with branches. If you look at the bar in the bottom left you can
                    see which branch you are on next to the git logo.</p>
                <img src="../images/vs-code-branch.png" alt="branch demo" width="300">
                <p>
                    If you click on this branch name VSCode will give you some options to manage branches as well.

                    repository for this to work.</p>
                <p>
                <p class="important"><strong>NOTE:</strong> You will need to be added as a collaborator of the repo in
                    order to
                    do
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    You will need to publish your branch to github so that the remote repository knows about your
                    changes.
                </p>
                <code>
    git push -u origin "name_of_your_branch"
</code>
                <p>Alternatively you can use VSCode. The little button next to the branch name that looks like a cloud
                    with an arrow in it will publish your branch. Note that all of these VScode helpers are just running
                    the commands we are typing.</p>

                <p>
                <p>
                    In git a commit is a save point of your changes. You can create as many as you want. Each commit
                    will have a unique id.
                </p>
                <p>To create a commit requires 2 steps the first is called staging and is a way to preview what you are
                    going to commit. This is useful if you don't want to commit everything or what to double check
                    things.The second stage is actually commit the things you have staged.</p>
                <h3>Staging</h3>
                <p>
                    To stage all the files you have changed use the following. Note the full stop after the add.
                </p>
                <code>
                        git add .
                    </code>
                <p>
                    Alternatively you can specify file names.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use the the following to see which files you have staged.
                </p>
                <code>
                    git status
                </code>
                <img src="../images/status-demo.png" alt="status demo" width="300">
                <p>
                    Alternatively you can use the VSCode git hub menu. On the left menu click on the github icon (often
                    the third one down) and you should see the following:
                </p>
                <img src="../images/vscode-github.png" alt="github demo" width="400">
                <p>You can use the various buttons here to stage or unstage your changes. If you click on one of the
                    file names VSCode will show you the changes you have made.</p>
                <img src="../images/vscode-changes.png" alt="github demo" width="400">
                <h3>Commit</h3>
                <p>
                    Once you have staged your changes and are happy to commit them you can use the following:
                </p>
                <code>
                    git commit -m "MESSAGE"                
                </code>
                <p>
                    Replace the "MESSAGE" with a sensible note (wrapped in double quotes) about what changes you are
                    making. Note this
                    will be visible to yourself and other developers forever so it is good practice to make the message
                    meaningful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Example
                </p>
                <code>
                    git commit -m "Added a paragraph to the github page"
                </code>
                <p>
                    To view all your commits you can use
                </p>
                <code>
                    git log 
                </code>
                <img src="../images/log-demo.png" alt="git log" width="400">
                <p>
                    Alternatively the timeline view in VSCode can show you this as well.
                </p>
                <h3>Summary</h3>

                <p class="important"><strong>NOTE:</strong> You will need to be added as a collaborator of the repo in

                    To add your commits to the remote branch in github you need to push them up.

                <code>
                    git push

                    That's about it.

                <p>Alternatively you can use VSCode. The same button we used to publish the branch can be used to push
                    and pull any changes as well.</p>

                    Often other developers will have made changes to the master branch (or any other branch) whilst you
                    have been working on your stuff. To get the latest changes to any branch you need to pull them down.
                    It is advised to do this before branching off master.

                <h2>How to merge your changes in</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you have created your branch and pushed it up to github you can go and have a look at it and
                    create a Pull Request. A Pull Request is a way of checking your work and getting other developers to
                    review it before moving it in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go to your repo in github then go to the code tab and click on branches.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/github-code-and-branches.png" alt="code" width="600" />
                <p>Next to your branch click on "New Pull Request"</p>
                <img src="../images/new-pr.png" alt="code" width="600" />
                <p>
                    On the next screen fill in a useful comment. Other developers will be able to see this so take some
                    time here. When your done click on "Create pull request".
                </p>
                <img src="../images/new-pr-screen.png" alt="code" width="600" />
                <p>You can review the changes by going to the "Files Changed" tab and adding a review. "Approve" and
                    "Submit" the review if you are happy. Request changes otherwise.</p>
                <img src="../images/approve-PR.png" alt="code" width="600" />
                <p>
                    When the PR has been approved. You can click on "Merge pull request" on the "Conversation" tab. You
                    will be asked to confirm. Do so if you want to merge it in.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/megre-pr.png" alt="code" width="600" />
                <p>Once this is done your changes will appear on the master branch.</p>
                <p>To see this happening, switch to the master branch</p>
                <code>
                    git checkout master
                </code>
                <p>
                    Then pull the latest changes.
                </p>
                <code>
                    git pull
                </code>
                <p>
                    You should see your changes appear.

                    How to host your site in github pages.
                </h2>
                <p class="important"><strong>NOTE:</strong>This is slightly different to other descriptions of how to do
                    this (explained below).</p>
                <p>
                <p>
                    Github can be used to host a static website on the internet. There is a lot of functionality here
                    that you can use including using this a CMS or similar. For now we are just going to host a static
                    page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go to "Settings" then down to the "Pages" tab on left
                </p>
                <img src="../images/pages-1.png" alt="code" width="600" />
                <p>
                    Under the "Source" drop down select the main branch. Then click on Save.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/pages-2.png" alt="code" width="600" />
                <p>
                    You will then see the URL of your site. Note this will take about 10 minutes to come through.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/pages-3.png" alt="code" width="600" />
                <p>
                    The github documentation will give you a slightly different way of doing this were you create the
                    repo with a specific name. This is used for hosting a main site for your organisation and is
                    recommended best practice in most cases.
                    However for our purposes we have done it slighlty differently. The only downside is that the url
                    will have the repo name in it. For this example this is fine.
